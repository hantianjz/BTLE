BTLE
========
This is a free and open-source Bluetooth low Energy (BLE) software suite developed by me.

This project was originally forked from on [BTLE](https://github.com/JiaoXianjun/BTLE) but have since been heavily refactored and modified.

This project is purely meant for self education purpose.
